# Solar-DISCOvery
This is the project of team Solar DISCOvery made for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023

We have included few files for diffrent stages of our project. All were necesarry to complete our project.
Their tasks:
- helper_functions, DataSpliting, DataMerging, FileReader - those scripts were used for preparation, normalization and manipulation of our "Raw" data.
- ReferenceDataframe, plotter - those scripts were used for validation of our Bz parameter calculation and later for improving our deep-learning models for space weather prediction.
- DataInterpolation - this script was used to calculate possible data for small (<2hours) data gaps.
- Dst, Kp - those scripts train our space weather predicition models (Kp index, Dst index) and save them as separate files.
